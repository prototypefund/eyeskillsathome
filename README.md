# EyeSkillsAtHome

EyeSkills is aimed at people with Amblyopia and Strabismus - to help them understand this condition and understand how their visual system really works.

EyeSkillsAtHome provides scaffolding for defining an audio/VR driven interface to encapsulate the EyeSkills Framework and environments that are built with that framework.

The goal is to produce a polished user experience whereby participants can literally experience what they see, and gradually develop - day for day - the vocabulary and scientific understanding they need to communicate with Ophthalmologists.

Amblyopia and Strabismus are complex conditions, weighed down by a mass of often ambiguous but seemingly highly technical scientific jargon.  Included in this repository are two 3D models, fully rigged and weighted, for two characters called Domi and Supti.  These provide a vehicle for an initially story telling approach based on metaphor.  They also provide characters which can be directly used within 3D visual training games, to provide continuity.
